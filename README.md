# praw_post_growth
Measures the growth of Reddit submissions' scores/karma and stores them in JSON format. Can be configured to track different subreddits, different numbers of posts, for different lengths.

Uses [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to interact with Reddit API.

Data processing and charting is dependent on matplotlib.
